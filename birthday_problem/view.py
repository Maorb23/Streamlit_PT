    ## **About the Birthday Problem**

    The Birthday Problem asks:  
    **What is the probability that at least two people in a group share the same birthday?**

    While it seems unlikely, the math is surprising:
    - In a group of just **23 people**, there's over a **50% chance** that two share a birthday.
    - In a group of **50 people**, the chance rises to **97%**.

    This simulation Uses **realistic birth dates probabilities in the US from 2019** with 0 perturbation. You can adjust the perturbation level to see how it affects the distribution of birthdays and the probability of shared birthdays.
