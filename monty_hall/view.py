    The **Monty Hall problem** is a classic probability puzzle:  
    You're on a game show with 3 doors. Behind one is a prize.  
    You choose a door, then the host (who knows what's behind the doors) opens a different one to show a goat.  
    You now have the option to **stick** with your original choice or **switch**.

    What should you do?

    Use the slider below to run simulations and see which strategy works better.
